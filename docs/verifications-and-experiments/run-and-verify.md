The Chaos Toolkit supports a number of commands and options, if you have [Chaos Toolkit][InstallCtk] installed, execute the ```chaos``` command, you will see output like:
```bash
Usage: chaos [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version                   Show the version and exit.
  --verbose                   Display debug level traces.
  --no-version-check          Do not search for an updated version of the
                              chaostoolkit.

  --change-dir TEXT           Change directory before running experiment.
  --no-log-file               Disable logging to file entirely.
  --log-file TEXT             File path where to write the command's log.
                              [default: chaostoolkit.log]

  --log-format [string|json]  Console logging format: string, json.
  --settings TEXT             Path to the settings file.  [default:
                              /Users/grant/.chaostoolkit/settings.yaml]

  --help                      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  discover  Discover capabilities and experiments.
  info      Display information about the Chaos Toolkit environment.
  init      Initialize a new experiment from discovered capabilities.
  run       Run the experiment loaded from SOURCE, either a local file or a...
  validate  Validate the experiment at PATH.
```

This shows the core Chaos Toolkit support for the ```chaos run``` command.

To add the ability to run Verifications and to publish the results to ChaosIQ you need to install the [ChaosIQ Plugin][InstallChaosIQPlugin]. Once the plugin is installed run the ```chaos``` command again and you will see:

```bash
Usage: chaos [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version                   Show the version and exit.
  --verbose                   Display debug level traces.
  --no-version-check          Do not search for an updated version of the
                              chaostoolkit.

  --change-dir TEXT           Change directory before running experiment.
  --no-log-file               Disable logging to file entirely.
  --log-file TEXT             File path where to write the command's log.
                              [default: chaostoolkit.log]

  --log-format [string|json]  Console logging format: string, json.
  --settings TEXT             Path to the settings file.  [default:
                              /Users/grant/.chaostoolkit/settings.yaml]

  --help                      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  disable   Disable a ChaosIQ feature
  discover  Discover capabilities and experiments.
  enable    Enable a ChaosIQ feature
  info      Display information about the Chaos Toolkit environment.
  init      Initialize a new experiment from discovered capabilities.
  org       Set ChaosIQ organization
  publish   Publish your experiment's journal to ChaosIQ
  run       Run the experiment loaded from SOURCE, either a local file or a...
  signin    Sign-in with your ChaosIQ credentials
  team      Set ChaosIQ team
  validate  Validate the experiment at PATH.
  verify    Run the verification loaded from SOURCE, either a local file or...

```

The ChaosIQ plugin adds some additional commands to the core Chaos Toolkit CLI, this includes commands to ```signin``` to ChaosIQ and the command to ```verify```.

You now have availalbe ```chaos run``` to run an Experiment and ```chaos verify``` to run a Verification. The execution is different for both.

## Chaos Run

the ```chaos run``` command will execute the experiment given as the SOURCE parameter, an experiment can be specified either a local file or a  HTTP resource:

```bash
ENDPOINT_URL=https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=2000; \
chaos run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-chaos/experiment-catalog/master/local/url-responds/url-responds.json
```
will give output similar to:

```bash
[2020-03-18 10:21:26 INFO] Validating the experiment's syntax
[2020-03-18 10:21:26 INFO] Experiment looks valid
[2020-03-18 10:21:26 INFO] Running experiment: Checks the hypothesis that a URL responds with a 200 status
[2020-03-18 10:21:28 INFO] Execution available at http://console.chaosiq.dev/ChaosIQ/Staging/executions/6f38b6c5-cf44-4dec-a7b5-7ec6ee03352a

[2020-03-18 10:21:35 INFO] Steady state hypothesis is met!
[2020-03-18 10:21:38 INFO] Action: dummy step
[2020-03-18 10:21:40 INFO] Steady state hypothesis: Application is normal
[2020-03-18 10:21:43 INFO] Probe: application-must-respond-normally
[2020-03-18 10:21:46 INFO] Steady state hypothesis is met!
[2020-03-18 10:21:47 INFO] Let's rollback...
[2020-03-18 10:21:49 INFO] No declared rollbacks, let's move on.
[2020-03-18 10:21:50 INFO] Experiment ended with status: completed
```

If that same experiment is stored locally in a file e.g. ```url-responds.json```, it can be executed as:

```bash
ENDPOINT_URL=https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=2000; \
chaos run url-responds.json
```
The output will be the same as shown above, the only difference is when the
```chaos run``` is provided with a URL it downloads the experiment from the
HTTP resource first. The execution then performs the following steps:

* Validate the experiment and if it is syntactically valid it will run it.
* The steady state hypothesis is checked.
* Execute any methods in the experiment (the experiment can include an array of methods).
* The steady state hypothesis is then checked again.
* Finally if there are any rollbacks then these are executed.

When connected to ChaosIQ the result of running an Experiment can be seen on
the Executions pages:

![Executions Summary][ExecutionsSummary]

If you select the details button for your Experiment can view the detail of the
 execution:

![Executions Details][ExecutionsDetail]

If you expand the Experiment Steady-State Hypothesis you can see the
Steady-State used:

![Experiment Journal][ExperimentJournal]


## Chaos Verify

The ```chaos verify``` command is added to the Chaos Toolkit CLI by the
ChaosIQ plugin. A ```chaos verify``` command will execute the verification
provided the SOURCE parameter. A verification can be specified either a local
file or a  HTTP resource:

```bash
chaos verify https://console.chaosiq.dev/assets/verifications/13e11c55-8fd9-4737-b43f-b62ea763cc6f.json
```

If that same verification is downloaded and stored locally in a file e.g. ```verify-staging-dummy-action.json```, it can be executed as:

```bash
chaos verify verify-staging-dummy-action.json
```

The output is similar for both commands:

```bash

```

 The only difference is when the ```chaos verify``` is provided with an HTTP resource, it downloads the verification first. The execution then performs the following steps:

* Validate the verification/experiment is syntactically correct and if it is valid it will run it.
* The steady state hypothesis is checked.
* Execute any methods in the verification.
* The steady state hypothesis is then checked again.
* Then a process is started that will execute the Steady State Hypothesis at the ```frequency-of-measurement``` defined in the Verification, for the ```duration-of-conditions``` (in the case above it takes a measurement every 3 seconds for a period of 10 seconds).
* Finally if there are any rollbacks then these are executed.

When connected to ChaosIQ the result of running a Verification can be seen on the insights page:

![Insights Summary][InsightsSummary]

If you select the details button for your Verification can view the detail of the Verification execution:

![Insights Detail][InsightsDetail]

The details view includes information about the Objective, the Measurement used and the Verification. It shows the Verification Run Timeline that includes a timeline chart of samples.
