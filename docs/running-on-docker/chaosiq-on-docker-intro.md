This *how to* looks at how you can run Chaos Toolkit with ChaosIQ as a Docker image.
We are going to use the ChaosIQ ```chaosiq/chaostoolkit``` Docker image from Docker Hub, but if you want to build your own custom Docker image it is covered here [Build a Custom Docker Image](/chaosiq-on-docker/build-a-custom-docker-image/)

To run with the ChaosIQ ```chaosiq/chaostoolkit``` Docker image see:

* [Run an Experiment with Docker](../run-experiment/)
* [Run an Experiment with Docker and ChaosIQ](../run-with-chaosiq/)
* [Run an Experiment with Docker and ChaosIQ](../run-verification/)
